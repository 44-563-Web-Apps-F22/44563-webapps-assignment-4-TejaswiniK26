 <h6 class="name">PHOEBE</h6>    
                <p class="song">When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
                   She wanders to and fro;
              Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
              And to all questions she replies,
                   With a sad "Heigh-ho!"

              'Tis but a little word—"Heigh-ho!"
              So soft, 'tis scarcely heard—"Heigh-ho!"
                   An idle breath—
                   Yet life and death
              May hang upon a maid's "Heigh-ho!"

              When maiden loves, she mopes apart,
                   As owl mopes on a tree;
              Although she keenly feels the smart,
              She cannot tell what ails her heart,
                   With its sad "Ah, me!"

                   'Tis but a foolish sigh—"Ah, me!"
              Born but to droop and die—"Ah, me!"
                   Yet all the sense
                   Of eloquence
              Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"

                Yet all the sense
                   Of eloquence
              Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
                   "Ah, me!", "Ah, me!"

                Yet all the sense
                   Of eloquence
              Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"</p>

<h6 class="name">WILFRED</h6>   <p class="speech WILFRED">Mistress Meryll!</p>

<h6 class="name">PHOEBE</h6>    <p class="direction">[looking up]</p> <p class="speech PHOEBE">Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go
    away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.</p>

<h6 class="name">WILFRED</h6>   <p class="speech WILFRED">Haven't you anything to say to me?</p>

<h6 class="name">PHOEBE</h6>    <p class="speech PHOEBE">Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
    littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars
    in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently
    comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all
    ready for work? Ugh! you brute!</p>

<h6 class="name">WILFRED</h6>   <p class="speech WILFRED">These allusions to my professional duties are in
    doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because
    I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-
    tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We
    can't all be sorcerers, you know. <p class="direction">[PHOEBE is annoyed]</p>
    <p class="speech WILFRED">Ah! you brought that upon yourself.</p>

<h6 class="name">PHOEBE</h6>    <p class="speech PHOEBE">Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer. He's a man of
    science and an alchemist.</p>

<h6 class="name">WILFRED</h6>   <p class="speech WILFRED">Well, whatever he is, he won't be one for long, for
    he's to be beheaded to-day for dealings with the
    devil. His master nearly had him last night, when the
    fire broke out in the Beauchamp <p class="direction">[pronounced Bee'cham]</p>
    <p class="speech WILFRED">Tower.</p>

<h6 class="name">PHOEBE</h6>    <p class="speech PHOEBE">Oh! how I wish he had escaped in the confusion! But
    take care; there's still time for a reply to his
    petition for mercy.</p>
